# nntp
A modern Usenet library for Python

nntp is a fork of the (now deprecated) nntplib module from the Python standard library. The goal of nntp is to continue to support NNTP and Usenet in the Python ecosystem post-deprecation and to update the legacy code within the module to meet modern standards. nntp does not strive to maintain backwards compatibility with nntplib and you should use something like [mcepl's independent nntplib module](https://git.cepl.eu/cgit/python/nntplib/]) instead. 

> [!CAUTION]
> nntp is under active development and should not be considered production ready yet.
